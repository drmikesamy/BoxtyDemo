# Boxty Demo

A full-stack modular monolith starter framework, with multi-tenancy, multi role, fine grained CRUD permissioning autogenerated for every entity. 

Blazor Webassembly frontend, .NET Core WebAPI backend. Postgres DB. Uses Keycloak for authentication and authorisation at the role level (.NET backend deals with permissions).

## Getting Started

### Starting the Application

Start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build and start the client application (Blazor WebAssembly)
- Build and start the server application (ASP.NET Core API)
- Start all dependent services (database, etc.)
- Enable hot reload for automatic updates during development

**Note:** Make sure Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is running before executing the docker compose command.

### Restarting Individual Services

To rebuild and restart a specific service:

```bash
# Restart the client only
docker compose up --build chapp.client

# Restart the server only
docker compose up --build chapp.server
```

## Stopping the Applications

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or run:

```bash
docker compose down
```
